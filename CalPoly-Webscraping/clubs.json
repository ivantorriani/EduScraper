Four headstrong visionaries: Susan Kim, Fannie Pon, Jill Yoshimura, and Reina Yuan, initiated the concept of having an organization that would provide them, as well as other young college women, the opportunity to experience sisterhood and to promote what they felt was integral to the development of successful women. After proposing their ideas to women at the Berkeley campus, they, along with ten strong and willful fellow women, became the founding sisters of alpha Kappa Delta Phi.\n  Our chapter here at Cal Poly was established in the Spring of 1996 by six strong women dedicated to promoting the values of sisterhood, scholarship, leadership, service, and Asian-American awareness. Now, over twenty years later, our house is stronger than ever and expanding rapidly. While we will always hold dear in our hearts the lasting tradition and strong foundation our sisters before us have established, we are only beginning another phase as the addition of more sisters bring with it many new ideas and insights.\nFULL FLEDGED CHAPTERS\n\u0392 \u2014 University of California, Davis\n\u0394 \u2014 University of California, Santa Cruz\n\u0396 \u2014 Stanford University\nH \u2014 The University of Texas at Austin\n\u0398 \u2014 University of Pennsylvania\nI \u2014 University of Houston\n\u039b \u2014 University of Michigan, Ann Arbor\n\u039d \u2014 Pennsylvania State University\n\u039e \u2014 San Jose State University\n\u039f \u2014 California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo\n\u03a0 \u2014 University of Washington\n\u03a1 \u2014 State University of New York, Buffalo\n\u03a3 \u2014 University of Virginia\n\u03a4 \u2014 Cornell University\n\u03a5 \u2014 University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign\n\u03a7 \u2014 University of Oklahoma\n\u03a8 \u2014 Rutgers University\n\u0391\u0391 \u2014 University of South Florida\n\u0391\u0392 \u2014 Duke University\n\u0391\u0393 \u2014 State University of New York, Stony Brook\n\u0391\u0394 \u2014 University of Florida\nAE \u2014 University of Wisconsin, Madison\nAZ \u2014 University of Illinois, Chicago\n  Check out our website to learn more about us!",

        "club_description": "The California Polytechnic State University Amateur (Ham) Radio Club (CPARC) has a long tradition of communications service on campus and in the community of San Luis Obispo. The club was founded in 1947, making the Cal Poly Amateur Radio Club the oldest club on campus.\nOur club station, W6BHZ, is equipped with high-frequency radio transceivers capable of worldwide communications. The station also acts as a San Luis Obispo County Emergency Communications Center, as it is fully equipped with emergency power and radio equipment to support various public safety agencies in the event of a disaster. The club trains routinely with local agencies in mock-disaster situations and has provided emergency communications during the Highway 41 Fire, the Loma Prieta earthquake, and other disasters both local and statewide. The club also supports other, non-emergency events such as bicycle races, triathlons, and parades. Club radio operators maintain communications both for event logistics and medical emergencies.\n-\nThe club maintains a repeater system to extend the range of handheld radios for club members and other licensed amateur radio operators in the San Luis Obispo area. The club also has a number of ways to connect to our local repeater through internet linking such as through EchoLink or All Star Network. The club is also working on constantly developing new projects with students from different majors in the club so that they can apply the concepts taught in class with the Cal Poly \"Learn By Doing\" philosophy. The club continues to move into the future with expanded Internet connectivity, digital radio projects, and additional wide-area-linked radio systems.\n-\nAmateur radio is a hobby that attracts a wide range of people interested in all facets of radio communications. Involvement in amateur radio allows people to practice their public speaking skills as well as the advancement of one\u2019s knowledge of radio theory, electronics, and emergency management. The Cal Poly philosophy is \u201cLearn by Doing,\u201d and involvement in the Cal Poly Amateur Radio Club embraces this philosophy to its fullest.\n-\nThe Cal Poly Amateur Radio Club strives to create a welcoming environment where everyone can feel accepted and respected as an individual. As an organization, we choose to support and embrace diversity and inclusion within the club as well as within the amateur radio community as a whole. Amateur radio is to be enjoyed by everyone, and discrimination based on race, religion, gender, gender expression, age, disability, or sexual orientation will not be tolerated.\n-\nIf you\u2019re curious, we\u2019d love it if you would attend one of our virtual bi-weekly meetings or stop by The Shack or our Discord Server to say hello. Also, feel free to email calpolyradioclub@gmail.com for more information about the club. You are also welcome to check out our ongoing club projects Trello page where you can get involved with the club!\n-\nhttps://www.w6bhz.org/",

Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.\nMany computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.\nThere really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!",

Many movies, TV shows, video games, books, and more all have complex storylines that require context and discussions to truly understand. Our purpose is to bring hidden details and theories to light in an effort to piece together a cohesive narrative. Mystery and vagueness are our favorite contributors to the lore of a story. We hope to also encourage students to think critically on the more hidden meanings of things outside of this club as well, encouraging an open mind on all fronts of life. In our club, there will be no correct answer. All interpretations of the meanings and storylines behind different stories will be encouraged and accepted.",

We hold manual dexterity workshops, visit dental schools, bring in guest dental speakers & admissions representatives, and give basic information on what classes to take and how to prepare for dental school.\nThe club also provides the opportunity to give back to our nearby communities through dental-related community service. We learn best from our peers who have done the same thing, so sharing our experiences and ideas knocks down all obstacles between us and our future as dentists.

It can mean design, innovation, and DIY craftsmanship. A means of living for some and a community for all. Even a rapidly growing industry. \n  Van Life, as we see it, isn\u2019t exclusive to a traditional \u201cvan\u201d either: \nWe recognize this same movement no matter the form! Truck campers, trailer-based tiny homes, whatever it may be - we welcome it!    \n  What does the Van Life Club do? \nAt our core we seek to host a community of individuals with interest, to any degree, in Van Life.\n   The scope of the club often includes community meetups (with converted vans on display!), local caravan & camping trips, discussion around interior & accessory design, and networking with established brand & organizations. We also support the outreach of emergency housing resources provided by the campus Basic Needs team.  \n--- \nInvolved, interested, or intrigued by Van Life?

Outside of our certificate series, we are committed to advancing the leadership skills of the entire campus community\u2013in clubs, classrooms, and peer-to-peer mentoring. Not every leader is a Mustang, but every Mustang is a leader.\n    We offer the following Leadership Certificates each quarter:\n  Emerging Leadership Series:\nBuild leadership skills, practice teamwork and communication skills, and connect with other student leaders through an inclusive lens. The Emerging Leaders Series is open to all students (no experience required), and provides an engaging way for students to expand their perspective on leadership.\n  Global Leadership Series:\nEngage in your leadership journey that is specifically gauged towards applying your leadership skills across cultures and contexts. You will explore personal, local, national, and global issues within leadership and identify the knowledge, skills, and awareness necessary to navigate these different contexts.\n  Peer Leadership Series:\nIncrease your leadership competency related to positional leadership roles you hold or aspire to hold (on or off campus). This certificate will increase students\u2019 confidence, self-efficacy, and toolkit in order to start or continue being an impactful positional leader. We believe that equity and social justice are inherent parts of leadership and thus have incorporated these topics into all four weeks of the series.\n  Social Change Leadership Series:\nSCL uses the Social Change Model of Leadership Development (the most widely-utilized model of leadership development on college campuses) as a framework for understanding leadership. Additionally, students who complete SCL will participate in two hours of service learning.",

There are so many ways to get involved even as a brand new member! The opportunity for leadership development and growth is an experience many of our sisters take to heart!\n\nFriendship is a word that is frequently used in reference to Greek life. In Alpha Omicron Pi, we emphasize the importance of authenticity. Our differences become our assets. For where one girl is weak, another girl is strong, and in this way we have established a support system that inspires each of us to exceed every expectation we set for ourselves.

Each year, our competitive team travels throughout California as well as across the United States to compete in 12+ large-scale tournaments against club tennis teams throughout the country. As a close-knit team, we are one big tennis family. Some of our best results include getting 2nd at 2023 National Championships, 6th at 2022 Nationals, 8th at 2018 Nationals, and consistently being one of the top teams in the country year after year. \n  Club tennis is comprised of a competitive team and a general team. To join the competitive team, you must attend a 2-day tryout process. At tryouts, a $15 tryout fee is required. The first day of tryouts consists of common hitting drills and basic shot practice, while the second day consists of competitive match play. If you cannot make the tryout dates, we will also have alternate tryouts held at a different time after tryouts. Outside of tryouts, alternate tryouts, and extenuating circumstances, there will be no other opportunities to join the competitive team. Players on the competitive team will pay $200 in dues for the year up-front or $80 per quarter.\n  Competitive team tryouts will be held on October 5th and 6th at the Cal Poly Tennis Courts. On both days, men will tryout from 12:30-2:30PM and women will tryout from 3:00-5:00PM.

The criteria for evaluation are INNOVATION, AESTHETICS, FUNCTIONALITY, DURABILITY, and ECOLOGICAL COMPATIBILITY.  To ensure a team's structure adheres to Design Village's Official Competition Rules, contestants must occupy their structures for the duration of the competition weekend.\n ",

Synthetic opioids, primarily fentanyl, causing 2/3rd of those deaths.\nExperimental drug use and addiction puts young people as one of the most at-risk populations for overdoses.\nFentanyl is lethal in small amounts (2mg) and many times people are unaware their drugs contain fentanyl.\n40% of overdose deaths could have been prevented if someone present knew how and when to intervene.\nOftentimes, there is a lack of education on and accessibility to these overdose prevention and response resources.\nOUR SOLUTION\nEducate and train individuals on how and when to intervene during a suspected overdose.\nInterventions include:\ncalling 911,\nthe use of fentanyl testing strips,\nthe ability to recognize the symptoms of an overdose,\nthe administration of Narcan to reverse an opioid overdose.\nOur online training is 100% free and encouraged for everyone to take.\nMake resources that prevent overdose-related deaths accessible to everyone across the country.\nEquip individuals with preventative (fentanyl test strips) and responsive (Narcan/naloxone) overdose tools.\nDirectly target outreach to most at-risk populations via in-person education and resource distribution.\nDe-stigmatize the conversation surrounding mental health, addiction, and overdoses.",

Read below for more information about what we do and FAQs. \n  FOOTBALL GAMES\nDuring the Fall quarter, Mustang Band meets as a class to prepare for football games, where we play pregame, halftime, and postgame routines in addition to other performances on campus throughout the day. Check out this playlist for some past halftime shows! Mustang Band Field Shows\n  PEP GAMES\nIn addition to football games, we also support other teams: volleyball, basketball, wrestling, and sometimes baseball throughout their seasons and continuing on with championship tournaments. The band is usually split into three different groups that play throughout the Fall and Winter quarters.\n\nOTHER CAMPUS EVENTS\nWe also play for various events throughout the year, including Big Fall Welcome during WoW, Poly Royal Parade during Open House, the SLO Holiday Parade, and more!\n  CHINESE NEW YEAR PARADE\nThe Chinese New Year Parade in San Francisco is a travel opportunity that we always enjoy participating in. We prepare during the Winter quarter and spend the weekend in San Francisco. There, we participate in a Battle of the Bands with another band (usually UC Davis) before playing in the parade itself. \n    FAQ\nHow do I join?\nPlease fill out this Interest Form and follow these instructions to audition. You can also reach out to either the directors or current officers in the band if you'd like to receive more information. \n  How much experience do I need to join?\nAlthough we expect everyone to know how to play their instruments, we take people of all marching experience levels (those who have never marched to those that have participated in drum corps) and teach them our marching style and basics during band camp right before school starts. \n  How much time commitment is there?\nBand camp occurs during WoW before school starts and the fall time commitment includes practices twice a week in addition to 3 pep games and a total of about 5 Saturday football games throughout Fall quarter. During Winter quarter, the time commitment includes one practice a week with a total of 5 pep games and optional participation to practice and perform in the Chinese New Year Parade.\n  What is the community like?\nMustang Band is a family that loves spending time together and supporting each other, whether it be in our music endeavors, personal lives, or through our academic interests. Throughout your years at Cal Poly, you can trust that Mustang Band members will be there to make new friendships, take classes together, and enjoy playing music together. \n  How do current members balance school and band?\nMost of our current members balance a full course load in addition to Mustang Band. With the minimal time commitment throughout each quarter, it is often thought of as a break from academically rigorous classes and an opportunity to unwind.",

Through student-led cultural presentations and workshops/presentations conducted by guest speakers, we cover a wide range of cultural topics such as life for Japanese Americans in the concentration camps, Japanese Americans in politics, Japanese holidays, traditions, and food, defining the term \"Nikkei\", and more. \nService\nWe believe in not just learning about our culture and community, but also finding ways to give back, so another component of our club is doing service projects to serve the local Japanese American community or the greater AAPI community. Our club is also very hands-on, as we believe that the best way to get members to care about our club's mission is by having them actively serve in some capacity. Staff and leadership opportunities are readily available for members to step into, which not only increases the engagement of our members but also allows our club to sustain itself in future years.\nSocial\nAt the end of the day, we are a social club too, and we pride ourselves on finding the perfect balance between learning about our culture and having fun. We have fams to help our members get to know a smaller group of people on a deeper level, we have socials with other NSUs, and our general meetings often consist of games, competitions. Our bigger in-person events include potlucks, picnics, basketball tournaments with other NSUs and intramurals, family competitions, beach days, and more.\nBasic Info\nGeneral Meetings: Tuesdays, 7:00-8:00 pm",

They are the pup's primary raiser and trainer and take their puppy with them to classes, out shopping, and to other various outings when possible for socialization and training. Puppy sitters help the raisers by sitting pups when the raiser is unable, to support the raisers and give them breaks, and to help socialize the pup through working with new people and experiencing new routines. Sits can last anywhere from an hour to a few days, depending on the needs of the raiser and the availability of sitters. General club members attend weekly meetings along with the raisers and sitters and get hands-on practice handling, training, and socializing the pups during meetings. We also organize occasional club outings on the weekends for additional socialization and hand-on handling and training in new locations. Previous club outings have been trips to downtown SLO, Morro Bay, and Cal Poly baseball games. Poly Pups is a fun and impactful club with incredible members and adorable puppies!",

With an emphasis on three core values: intersectional justice, community empowerment, and promoting authentic boldness. We invite the Cal Poly campus community to explore dismantling heteronormativity and the legacy of colonization. Pride envisions a community where people can openly explore their own understanding of gender and sexuality. \n  Location: \nUniversity Union, Building 65, Room 217  \nOperating Hours: \nStaffed Hours: 9:00am-5:00pm \nMonday-Friday \nCenter Space Hours: General University Union Hours. \nCenter Space Offerings: \nPrinting, snacks, sleeping, crafting, library, and desktops. \n  Our programming consists of quarterly and signature events. Below are examples of some past events. \nT-Party:  \nThis is a Trans and non-binary community space. It included a podcast circle, a craft circle, and a movie screening with Cal Poly Safer and the Native American and Indigenous Cultural Center. \nComing Out Week: \nA week that highlights the coming out experience in our community. It includes panels and time for the community to share their experiences. \nPride Prom: \nThis is an annual event that allows our students to experience prom in ways they may not have before.  \nWinter wonderland Drag Show: \nThis event was one of the drag shows we host throughout the year. \nPride Ballroom: \nOur brand-new ballroom event was in collaboration with BAEC, NAICC, LA CASA and MCC. This was an opportunity to celebrate the history and celebration that was created by QTPOC. At this event we had 4 houses and 4 categories to walk the runway for the judges and the crowd. This year's inspiration: CAMP.  \nTo stay up to date on the latest center news and programs, we recommend following our Cal Poly Now and center Instagram. \nIG: @calpoly_pride ",

This year is the first year that puente has expanded onto college campuses in order to have former puente students from high schools or community colleges come onto campus and feel an immediate community that they can identify with. Along with being a social club for Puentistas, we also host several campus tours for Puentistas who are thinking about applying to cal poly. Puente is important because it primarily serves low income, first generation students in order to restore equity and help them cross over the bridge. Puente is a family and it is open to anyone who wants to succeed, but especially those who want to see others succeed!",

Some objectives are to strengthen cultural, personal, and educational goals while promoting moral, academic, and family support. Through mutual support and encouragement, Sigma Omega Nu instills the importance of education and academic success in the college environment.\nHistory\nSigma Omega Nu was founded on November 6, 1996. It was the first Latina interest sorority founded and established at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo. At the time, no group existed specifically for the academic, cultural or family support of Latina women pursuing higher education.\nThe eight Latina women who founded the sorority felt that there was a need for a strong Latina voice on their campus so they created an organization that would fulfill that unmet need. These eight young women were recognized as the Founding Mothers of the chapter at Cal Poly.\nAchieving Goals \nSince the creation of Sigma Omega Nu the founding mothers have struggled to provide an outlet for women. Together members have worked hard to inform the community on the importance of Latina/o issues. The sisters have participated in various community service programs. Members of Sigma Omega Nu hope to obtain the support of all women by being positive role models. Members strive on creating supportive and lasting relationships with each other. The sisters of Sigma Omega Nu will continue to stress high commitment, professional and social ethics, as well as their dedication in continuing their exemplary commitment for a strong sisterhood.",

We provide a balance of social, professional, and academic events for anyone interested in civil engineering. Our club has been active since 1980, and we continue to maintain our successful endeavors each year. We have a myriad of events, teams, and opportunities for students to get involved in and find what suits them best. We have multiple technical project teams, including Concrete Canoe and Steel Bridge, that welcome anyone who wants a more hands-on learning experience. We have a spectacular mentorship program that builds relationships between underclassmen and upperclassmen. Our social events encourage students to get to know one another outside the classroom and take a break from their busy academic schedules. We participate in inspiring community service events that give back to the community and introduce civil engineering to K-12 students. Leadership positions instill skills in our officers that cannot be taught in the classroom. We even have an amazing winter career fair and quarterly firm tours to help students leap into the professional world. \nThis is the perfect place to get to know your fellow students while camping, playing on our intramural sports teams, participating in a beach cleanup, or going to a picnic. The friends and memories you make here stay with you beyond graduation. Just ask our alumni, who are always happy to join us for events throughout the year! \nIf you want to learn more about civil engineering, get a kickstart to your professional career with an internship or full-time job, get your hands dirty with one of our project teams, or just get to know some pretty cool people, Cal Poly SCE is the club for you! \nMake sure to watch our Club Showcase video from this year's Week of Welcome to learn what our officers love about SCE!

The six founding members of the Alpha Pledge Class were Craig Randall Park, Stephen Mathew McCallon, Jeffrey Scott Mastin, Kevin Dale Russell, Dean Bedard, and Duane Bedard.\nIn the chapter's 35 years of establishment, transition and growth have been essential, but after a rebuilding initiative that began in February 2007, the chapter is now stronger than ever. For many years, Epsilon Delta has demonstrated its excellence by leading the Cal Poly Greek community in grade-point-average, athletic participation, and community involvement. Our recruitment has made great strides over the last couple of recruitment periods and we are now one of the fastest-growing chapters on Cal Poly's campus reaching close to 100 active members.",

We have weekly meetings from 8-10pm, alternating between Wednesdays and Thursdays. The first meeting of every month is a freewrite, where we pick a writing prompt and see how it inspires us; the remainder of our meetings are workshops, where you are welcome to bring a short piece you have already written to share for constructive feedback. You are also always welcome to attend without sharing your work, to provide or receive support! \nOur club is always free to attend and participate in. We welcome members of all experience levels, whether you've had a pen in your hand since the day you were born or you've never written a word in your life until now. All genres and formats of writing are welcome, from nonfiction to fiction, poetry to prose, fantasy to horror, experimental pieces to memoirs, or screenplays to comic strips! We welcome members of every background and identity and constantly strive to make our space queer-inclusive, anti-racist, and accessible to those with disabilities; writing is for everyone. \nTo connect with us, shoot an email to cpwriterscollective@gmail.com . That's the best way to be added to our mailing list, join our Discord server, and get notifications for each upcoming club meeting!

Our team is rooted in our commitment to work together and uphold academic and athletic success. That being said we are a cut sport that holds try outs at the beginning of each school year. We practice three times a week along with hosting other club events (team dinners, holiday gift exchanges, hikes, etc.) to facilitate team bonding. We travel to tournaments at other universities as well as host a tournament at Cal Poly each year! Catch us on the court or connect with us via Engage, email, or our linked social media platforms.
